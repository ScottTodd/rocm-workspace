## How to Request Reviews

### Single Review Type

Ask for a specific focused review:

```
"Review this PR with a focus on test coverage"
"Do a security review of these changes"
```

### Multiple Reviews in Parallel

Request multiple review types to run simultaneously:

```
"Run style, tests, and documentation reviews in parallel"
"Review this for architecture and security in parallel"
```

### Comprehensive Review (Default)

A comprehensive review covers all aspects:

```
"Review this PR"
"Review the changes on my branch"
```

## Tips for Effective Reviews

### For the Reviewer

1. **Stay focused:** When doing a focused review, ignore issues outside that scope
2. **Be thorough:** Within the focus area, be comprehensive
3. **Provide context:** Explain why something matters from this perspective
4. **Run in parallel:** Multiple focused reviews can run simultaneously
5. **Cross-reference:** Note when issues overlap between focus areas

### For the Requester (Human)

1. **Choose appropriate type:** Match review type to the change nature
2. **Use parallel reviews:** Run multiple types for comprehensive coverage
3. **Sequence reviews:** Do style/tests first, then architecture
4. **Save bandwidth:** Don't run all review types for trivial changes
5. **Iterate:** Fix blocking issues, then run focused reviews again

## Examples

### Example 1: New Feature

```
"Run architecture, tests, and documentation reviews in parallel"
```

This ensures:
- Design is sound (architecture)
- Feature is properly tested (tests)
- Feature is properly documented (documentation)

### Example 2: Bug Fix

```
"Run tests and security reviews in parallel"
```

This ensures:
- Fix is tested including edge cases (tests)
- Fix doesn't introduce vulnerabilities (security)

### Example 3: Refactoring

```
"Do a style review of this refactoring"
```

Focuses on:
- Code readability and consistency
- Naming conventions
- Organization improvements

### Example 4: Performance Optimization

```
"Run performance and tests reviews in parallel"
```

This ensures:
- Optimization is effective (performance)
- Optimization doesn't break functionality (tests)

### Example 5: Final Automated Review

```
"Run a comprehensive review"
```

Covers all aspects in a single automated review pass.
